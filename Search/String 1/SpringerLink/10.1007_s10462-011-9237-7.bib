abstract="Modern Software Engineering (SE) is characterized by the use of several models that establish and show the different states a software product goes through, from its initial conception to its end, passing across its development, setup and maintenance among others. Each phase produces a set of deliverables following different documentation standards, but in many cases, natural language text is a key aspect in the elaboration of such documents. This work surveys the state of the art in the application of text mining techniques to architectural software design, starting from the role of text documents during development phases, specifically the kind of text documents that can be subsequently exploited to assist architects in the complex task of designing software. Intelligent text analysis techniques utilized in software engineering tasks across the software life-cycle are detailed in order to analyze works focused on automatically bridging the gap between requirements and software architectures.",
